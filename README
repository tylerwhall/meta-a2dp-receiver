I. Adding the a2dp-receiver layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the a2dp-receiver layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the a2dp-receiver layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-a2dp-receiver \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-openembedded/meta-python \
    "


II. Misc
========

Building core-image-base should generate an image that should boot up on
qemux86. Bluetooth audio will work with QEMU's USB passthrough of a BT dongle
and regular HD audio emulation. The requirements for other machines are ALSA
drivers for your sound card and the btusb kernel module, if using a USB dongle.
This has been tested on qemux86 and on a PandaBoard built from meta-ti.
